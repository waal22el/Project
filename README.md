# Project
Our project is going to be a dungeon game that has mobs in it and a player. The aim of the game is to kill mobs and move through the dungeons, you get to fight mobs and can collect items from them if you manage to kill them. 
# Combat 
The player can kill mobs by hitting them. 
# Player
The player moves around the dungeon when they run into a mob that start chasing them. The player has a health bar and tries to kill the mobs in order to collect items into their inventory. 
# Mobs 
The mobs walk around the dungeon randomly and drop items when they are killed. There are several types of mobs with different themes.
# Shop
The player will be able to earn coins and buy items.

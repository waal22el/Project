# Project
Our project is going to be a math quiz game, its a dungeon game that has mobs in it and a player. The aim of the game is to find the bosses at the end of the game, you get to fight mobs and can collect items from them if you manage to kill them. 
# Combat 
The combat is turn based, where the player can make three types of attacks light, medium and heavy. When the player chooses one of these options he is given a math problem with a difficulty depending on the attack choice, the monsters simulate the same attack pattern by randomly choosing attacks with verying success chances. Bosses have special attacks that force the player to solve a math problemn in order to dodge. 
# Player
The player moves around the dungeon when they run into a mob a combat encounter is started. The player has a health bar and tries to kill the mobs in order to collect items into their inventory. 
# Mobs 
The mobs walk around the doungeon randomly and drop items when they are killed. There are several types of mobs with different themes.
